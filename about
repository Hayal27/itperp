I developed this system from scratch for the Ethiopian IT Park, designed for detailed planning, reporting, and staff communication, all based on the organization's structure. 
The frontend is built using React, while the backend is powered by Node.js. For the database, I utilized MySQL. To ensure security, I implemented JWT for authentication, password hashing, 
and additional technical code measures to safeguard against vulnerabilities.
